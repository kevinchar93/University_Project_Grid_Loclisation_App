# Grid Localisation App (Final Year Project)
This repo is one of a number from my final year project at university. This in particular is for a piece of software used to control the robot remotely and view an estimate of its position. More specific details about the project and the Grid Localisation App in particular can be found below.

### About the Project
My final year project at university was inspired somewhat by my placement year where I worked on programming embedded systems in the form of TV set top boxes, having had this experience I decided to work on a project that dealt with some form of embedded system. In the end I decided to construct and program a robot capable of localising itself in two dimensions.

By the end of the project I'd encountered issues that made me scale down the project. Ultimately I produced a robot that is capable of localising itself in only one dimension, however another piece of software which presents a simple simulation of two dimensional localisation was implemented instead.

The project report titled "[**An Implementation of a Mobile Robot with Localisation Capabilities**](https://github.com/kevinchar93/University_Project_Mobile_Platform_SW/blob/master/An%20Implementation%20of%20a%20Mobile%20Robot%20with%20Localisation%20Capabilities.pdf)" can be found in the root directory of this repo.

In total for the project 4 deliverables were created (links to repos in brackets):
* The actual physical robot
* The software on the robot's embedded platform ([Mobile Platform SW](https://github.com/kevinchar93/University_Project_Mobile_Platform_SW))
* Software used to control the robot remotely & estimate its position ([Grid Localisation App](https://github.com/kevinchar93/University_Project_Grid_Loclisation_App))
* A two dimensional Monte Carlo localisation simulator  ([Particle Filter Simulator App](https://github.com/kevinchar93/University_Project_Particle_Filter_Simulator_App))
